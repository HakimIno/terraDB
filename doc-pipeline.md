# Database System Development Roadmap

## Current Status Overview
This document outlines the development status and requirements for our database system, categorized by major components.

## 1. Transaction Management 游댮 Priority: Critical
### Implemented
- None

### To Be Implemented
- ACID Properties
- Isolation Levels
- Multi-version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
- Two-Phase Commit
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

## 2. Query Processing 游리 Priority: High
### Implemented
- Basic SQL Parser (High Performance)
- Simple Query Execution

### To Be Implemented
- Query Planner
- Cost-based Optimizer
- Join Algorithms
  - Hash Join
  - Merge Join
- Aggregation Engine
- Window Functions

## 3. Storage Engine 游릭 Priority: Medium
### Implemented
- Page Management
- Buffer Pool
- Memory Pool
- Basic File I/O

### To Be Implemented
- Table Space Management
- VACUUM/Cleanup
- Data Compression
- Automatic Partitioning

## 4. Indexing 游리 Priority: High
### Implemented
- None

### To Be Implemented
- B-tree Indexes

- Index-Only Scans

## 5. Distributed Features 游댮 Priority: Critical (ScyllaDB-level)
### Implemented
- None

### To Be Implemented
- Sharding
- Consensus Protocol
- Distributed Query Processing
- Node Management
- Cluster Coordination

## 6. Replication 游댮 Priority: Critical
### Implemented
- None

### To Be Implemented
- Master-Slave Replication
- Multi-Master Replication
- Conflict Resolution
- Streaming Replication
- Logical Replication

## 7. Security 游댮 Priority: Critical
### Implemented
- None

### To Be Implemented
- Authentication
- Authorization/Access Control
- Row-Level Security
- Encryption at Rest
- SSL/TLS Support

## 8. Monitoring & Management 游댮 Priority: Critical

- Admin Interface

## Implementation Status Summary
- 游릭 Completed Components: Basic Storage Engine features
- 游리 Partially Completed: Query Processing
- 游댮 Not Started: Transaction Management, Indexing, Distributed Features, Replication, Security, Monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Transaction Management implementation as it's critical for data integrity
2. Enhance Query Processing with advanced features
3. Implement core Indexing functionality
4. Develop Distributed Features and Replication in parallel
5. Implement Security features before production deployment
6. Set up Monitoring & Management tools

## Notes
- Priority levels are indicated by colored circles (游댮 Critical, 游리 High, 游릭 Medium)
- Production readiness requires completion of Security and Monitoring components
- ScyllaDB-level performance targets require robust Distributed Features implementation
